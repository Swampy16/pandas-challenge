Summary
The data is broken down into several useful areas,
Its easy to see if a higher budget means higher grades and vis versa or if more or less students should have a higher budget. This could easily be used to see where some schools could use more or less budget to either aid in the schools development.

Conclusions
	You would assume that the schools with the highest budget would be the most likely to have the highest grades, but that is not the case the school with the largest budget ($3,124,928.00) only has a 74% overall passing rate where the school with a budget of 585,858.00 has a overall passing rate of 95%.
Now the size of the school is a factor in the overall budget as well and can skew the data as well, more teachers and aids to pay but the % of students to school staff may widen as the student population increase leading to less attention for each student which could mean lower grades for more students.
